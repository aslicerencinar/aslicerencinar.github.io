    "text": "Who benefits from perceived masculinity? A visual survey experiment\nSlide presentation – 2023 EPSA\nAbstract: Physical features cannot be disregarded in the world of politics, where self-presentation and image are of critical importance. Facial masculinity is one of the many factors that influence our perceptions of politicians. Over the years, researchers have examined the relationship between facial masculinity and voting behaviour, investigating how these visual cues can affect our evaluation and selection of political leaders. Yet, the intricate relationship between facial masculinity’s influence on voting behaviour and a candidate’s race and gender still provides mixed findings. Using a novel visual digital conjoint experiment in which photorealistic virtual political candidates are generated using a state-of-the-art tool, the purpose of this study is to elucidate the significance of facial masculinity in the United States political sphere and its potential implications for democratic representation. I find that voters prefer lower facial masculinity in political candidates, which is mainly influenced by self-identified liberal voters, while conservative voters do not differ significantly in their preference based on the candidate’s race and gender. This study aims to spark a discussion on the significance of facial masculinity perceptions, with a focus on their multifaceted function in relation to the candidate’s race and gender. \nIdentity Priming in Campaigning: Field Experimental Evidence from Women Candidates in Germany\nwith Frederik Ferié and Florian Foos\nSlide presentation – 2023 EPSA\nAbstract: For female candidates, gender is not only a social characteristic, but also an important social identity and lived experience, which they discuss with voters on the campaign trail. However, while there is solid evidence on how gender influences vote choice, we know little about the effects of identity priming on how voters evaluate female candidates. This study seeks to advance our understanding of how messages that emphasize candidates’ social identities, including their gender identity, influence voter evaluations. Based on two field experiments that we conducted in collaboration with two female state parliamentary candidates in Germany, we show that emphasizing a candidates’ gender and discussing gender in combination with other social identities, can positively affect how voters view candidates. However, there is little evidence that this effect materialises via identity alignment between voters and candidates, or that priming gender identity independently affects vote choice when other social identities are primed.\n\nRevisiting the differential mobilisation hypothesis: An individual participant data meta-analysis\nwith Francisco Tomás-Valiente Jordá, Florian Foos and Peter John\nAbstract: This study tests whether GOTV interventions are more effective on subjects with higher voting propensities. If that is the case, GOTV interventions will affect the composition of the electorate. They could enlarge the participation gap by mobilising the kind of voters that already have high voting propensities to start with rather than under-represented groups. This hypothesis was tested and confirmed in Enos, Fowler and Vavreck (2014). However, over the last decade, a large number of new experimental data sets have been produced, which allow a further and more complete test of the differential mobilisation hypothesis. Building on Enos, Fowler and Vavreck (2014), we expand their analysis in three ways. First, we have access to a larger sample of GOTV experiments: whereas Enos, Fowler and Vavreck (2014) look at 11 experimental papers with a total of 24 GOTV treatment arms (all of them pre-2008 and from the US), we have so far identified 78 experimental data sets and are still expanding this sample. Second, we propose to use a method that has rarely been used in political science, which both accounts for the hierarchical nature of the data and relaxes functional form and common support assumptions: individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) in voting propensity bins. Third, drawing on our large dataset, we can describe the political, geographic and temporal contexts in which GOTV interventions have widened or narrowed participation gaps. \nPersistence of Voice Pitch Bias Against Policy Differences\nwith Ozgur Kibris (conditionally accepted)\nAbstract: Voters evaluate politicians not just on their policy positions and partisanship, but also on how they look and sound. But to what extent might these latter characteristics be traded for a more preferable policy stance? In this paper, we use an online experiment to study the relative effect on voter behavior of candidate voice pitch and policy differences between candidates. We first demonstrate a strong : in an election between candidates who are identical in every aspect but voice pitch, voters are significantly more likely to choose the one with the lower voice pitch. Voice pitch bias is higher in elections between men than women candidates. We then introduce a novel phenomenon. Persistence of voice pitch bias is the amount of policy difference needed to compensate for voice pitch bias. While persistence is also gender-dependent, the effect is now reversed: voice pitch bias is more persistent in elections between women than men candidates. Finally, as a possible mechanism we show that voters perceive candidates with a lower voice pitch as more competent and trustworthy. Our findings are robust against voters’ gender and other socio-economic characteristics."
